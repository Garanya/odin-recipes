    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is for simple and tasty BBQ ribs. First, prepare the ribs by removing the membrane and seasoning them with a homemade dry rub. Grill the ribs over indirect heat for about 2 to 2.5 hours, occasionally basting with BBQ sauce. During the last 15-30 minutes, apply more BBQ sauce to create a delicious glaze. Serve and enjoy!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 racks of baby back ribs (about 2-3 pounds each)</li>
        <li>1 cup BBQ sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the ribs:
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the membrane from the back of the ribs. You can use a butter knife to loosen the membrane, then grip it with a paper towel and peel it off.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create the dry rub:
            <ul>
                <li>In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper to create the dry rub.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Season the ribs:
            <ul>
                <li>Rub a light layer of olive oil or vegetable oil on both sides of the ribs to help the dry rub adhere better.</li>
                <li>Generously sprinkle the dry rub over the ribs, making sure to coat both sides evenly. Pat the rub into the meat for better adherence.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the grill:
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your grill to medium heat. If using a charcoal grill, wait until the coals are covered with ash and spread them out in an even layer.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Grill the ribs:
            <ul>
                <li>Place the ribs on the grill over indirect heat. If using a gas grill, turn off the burner(s) directly below the ribs, or if using a charcoal grill, position the ribs away from the coals.</li>
                <li>Close the grill lid and let the ribs cook for about 2 to 2.5 hours. During this time, you may occasionally baste the ribs with BBQ sauce for added flavor.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Finish with BBQ sauce:
            <ul>
                <li>During the last 15-30 minutes of cooking, brush a generous layer of BBQ sauce on both sides of the ribs. Allow the sauce to caramelize and create a sticky glaze.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Rest and serve:
            <ul>
                <li>Once the ribs are fully cooked and the sauce has caramelized, remove them from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes.</li>
                <li>Cut the ribs between the bones and serve with additional BBQ sauce on the side.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your delicious and simple BBQ ribs! They pair well with coleslaw, cornbread, or grilled vegetables.</p>
