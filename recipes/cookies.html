        <p>Make these delicious cookies by creaming butter with sugars, adding eggs and vanilla. Combine dry ingredients separately and then mix them with the wet ingredients. Fold in chocolate chips, form dough balls on a baking sheet, and bake until golden brown. Cool and enjoy with milk or ice cream! Perfect for sharing with loved ones.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until it's light and fluffy. Use a hand mixer or a stand mixer with the paddle attachment for this step.</li>
            <li>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, into the butter-sugar mixture. Mix in the vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Be careful not to over-mix the dough. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
            <li>Gently fold in the semisweet chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the cookie dough.</li>
            <li>Using a spoon or a cookie scoop, portion out balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving enough space between them as they will spread during baking.</li>
            <li>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for about 9-11 minutes or until the edges turn golden brown. The centers may appear slightly soft, but they will firm up as they cool.</li>
            <li>Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy your freshly baked Homemade Chocolate Chip Cookies with a glass of cold milk or a scoop of ice cream for an extra treat! These cookies are perfect for sharing with family and friends, and they are sure to be a hit at any gathering. Happy baking!</p>
