            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance the acidity of tomatoes)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>250g (9 oz) ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

            <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the lasagna noodles:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the noodles and lay them flat on a clean surface or kitchen towel to prevent sticking.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Prepare the meat sauce:
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, sautéing until they become soft and translucent.</li>
                    <li>Add the ground beef and cook until it's browned and cooked through, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, dried thyme, bay leaf, sugar (if using), salt, and black pepper. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally. This allows the flavors to meld together.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Prepare the ricotta mixture:
                <ul>
                    <li>In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with the egg. Mix until well combined.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Assemble the lasagna:
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
                    <li>In a baking dish (approximately 9x13 inches), spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom to prevent sticking.</li>
                    <li>Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then add a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle some shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese over the meat sauce.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the layers: noodles, remaining ricotta mixture, meat sauce, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
                    <li>Finish with a final layer of noodles, meat sauce, and more shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Bake the lasagna:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, tenting it slightly to prevent the cheese from sticking to the foil.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese on top is bubbly and lightly golden.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Let it rest and serve:
                <ul>
                    <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before serving. This will make it easier to slice and serve.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy your delicious and hearty Lasagna! Serve it with a side salad and garlic bread for a complete meal.</p>
